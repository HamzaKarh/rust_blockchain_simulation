This blockchain simulation was completed as an assessment for Webisoft.

`cargo build`

`cargo run`

Miner/accounts[0]  starts with all the coin

Feel free to change the BLOCK_MINING_TIME constant on main.rs to accommodate to the console.
The console should work either way but a slower mining time means a more visible console. 10-15 secs should do fine.

Commands :
    start_node : start the blockchain
    create_account : create a new account on the blockchain
    transfer : transfer funds from one account to another
    read_balance : read the balance of an existing account
